# Extjs 4 Demonstration with Spring 4.

I've tried to demonstrate Extjs 4 with spring. 
I've created a basic Email App for this purpose.

## How to Start
1. Import the project.
2. Perform maven update.
3. Clean Build.
4. In case, you wish to change the context root: 
    * In your project's Properties, choose "Web Project Settings".
    * Change "Context root" to "{desired}"
5. Add a server(Tomcat), publish & start the same. 
6. Please hit {context-path}/login to run the application.
7. Provide any valid email format to login.
8. {context-path}/mails/dashboard is the extjs page that user will be redirected to post login.
